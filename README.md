### Shell Completion

The tool supports shell completion for commands, flags, and arguments. To enable completion:

```bash
# For bash
mlp completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/mlp

# For zsh
mlp completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_mlp"

# For fish
mlp completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/mlp.fish
```

After enabling completion, you can use:
- Tab completion for commands: `mlp [tab]`
- Tab completion for log files: `mlp file [tab]`
- Tab completion for flag values: `mlp file log.txt --level [tab]`
- File path completion for relevant flags: `mlp file log.txt --output [tab]`

### Examples

Parse a single log file:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log
```

Parse a support packet:
```bash
mlp support-packet mattermost_support_packet.zip
```

Filter logs containing the word "error":
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --search "error"
```

Show only error-level logs:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --level error
```

Filter logs by user and output as JSON:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --user admin --json
```

Combine multiple filters:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --level error --search "database"
```

Filter logs by time range:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --start 2023-01-01T00:00:00 --end 2023-01-02T00:00:00
```

Use regular expressions for advanced filtering:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --regex "error.*database"
```

Export logs to CSV for spreadsheet analysis:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --csv logs_export.csv
```

Save output to a file:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --analyze --output analysis_report.txt
```

Show version information:
```bash
mlp version
```

Launch interactive TUI mode for exploring logs:
```bash
mlp file mattermost.log --interactive
```

Analyze logs using Claude AI:
```bash
# Using command line flag
mlp file mattermost.log --ai-analyze --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Using environment variable
export CLAUDE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
mlp file mattermost.log --ai-analyze

# Specify maximum number of log entries to analyze
mlp file mattermost.log --ai-analyze --max-entries 200

# Provide a problem statement to guide the analysis
mlp file mattermost.log --ai-analyze --problem "Users are reporting authentication failures"
```

Analyze support packet logs using Claude AI:
```bash
# Using command line flag
mlp support-packet mattermost_support_packet.zip --ai-analyze --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Using environment variable
export CLAUDE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
mlp support-packet mattermost_support_packet.zip --ai-analyze
```

## Output Format

### Pretty Print (Default)

The default output format includes:
- Colored timestamps and log levels for better readability
- Highlighted source/caller information
- Structured display of user information and additional details
- Summary count of displayed log entries

### JSON Output

When using the `--json` flag, the output will be formatted as a JSON array of log entries, useful for further processing or integration with other tools.

## Supported Log Formats

The parser supports both traditional Mattermost log formats and the newer JSON-formatted logs:

### Traditional Format
```
2023-04-15T14:22:34.123Z [INFO] api.user.login.success user_id=abc123 ip_address=192.168.1.1
```

### JSON Format
```
{"timestamp":"2025-02-14 17:11:10.308 Z","level":"debug","msg":"Email batching job ran.","caller":"email/email_batching.go:138","number_of_users":0}
```

## Support Packet Processing

The tool can extract and parse log files from Mattermost support packets. Support packets are ZIP files that contain server logs, configuration information, and diagnostic data. When using the `--support-packet` option, the tool will:

1. Extract log files from the ZIP archive
2. Parse each log file
3. Apply any specified filters (search term, level, user)
4. Display the combined results

This is particularly useful for analyzing logs from multi-node Mattermost deployments where each node's logs are included in the support packet.

## Log Analysis

The `--analyze` option provides a high-level overview of the log data, including:

- Basic statistics (total entries, time range, duration)
- Log level distribution and error rate
- Top log sources and active users
- Most frequent error messages
- Activity patterns by hour
- Common message patterns

This analysis helps quickly identify trends, issues, and patterns in large log files without having to manually review thousands of entries.

## Advanced Filtering

The tool provides several ways to filter logs:

- **Text Search**: Use `--search` to find logs containing specific text
- **Regular Expressions**: Use `--regex` for pattern matching
- **Level Filtering**: Use `--level` to focus on specific log levels
- **User Filtering**: Use `--user` to find logs related to specific users
- **Time Range**: Use `--start` and `--end` to filter logs within a specific time period

## Output Options

You can control how the results are displayed or saved:

- **Pretty Print**: Default colored output for human readability
- **JSON Format**: Use `--json` for machine-readable output
- **CSV Export**: Use `--csv` to export logs to a CSV file for spreadsheet analysis
- **File Output**: Use `--output` to save results to a file instead of displaying on screen

## Interactive Mode

The `--interactive` option launches a terminal-based UI that allows you to:

- Browse through logs with keyboard navigation
- Filter logs interactively
- View detailed information about each log entry
- Search within the loaded logs

This mode is particularly useful for exploring large log files or investigating complex issues.

## AI-Powered Log Analysis

The `--ai-analyze` option uses Claude Sonnet API to provide an intelligent analysis of your logs. This feature:

- Sends a sample of your logs to Claude for analysis
- Provides a comprehensive report of issues and patterns
- Identifies potential root causes for errors
- Offers recommendations for resolution
- Gives context and insights that might not be obvious from statistical analysis

To use this feature, you need a Claude API key from Anthropic. You can obtain one by signing up at [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/).

You can provide the API key in two ways:
1. Using the `--api-key` command line flag
2. Setting the `CLAUDE_API_KEY` environment variable (more secure)

Note: When using AI analysis, a limited number of log entries are sent to the Claude API to stay within token limits. By default, the tool sends up to 100 entries, but you can adjust this with the `--max-entries` flag.

You can also provide a problem statement with the `--problem` flag to help guide the AI analysis toward specific issues you're investigating.

## Logging

MLP uses structured logging for its output. By default, it logs at the INFO level. You can modify the logging level using these flags:

- `--verbose`: Show detailed debug information
- `--quiet`: Only show error messages

These flags are mutually exclusive - if both are provided, `--quiet` takes precedence.

Examples:
```bash
# Default behavior - show info and error messages
mlp file logfile.txt

# Show detailed debug information
mlp file logfile.txt --verbose

# Only show errors
mlp file logfile.txt --quiet
```
